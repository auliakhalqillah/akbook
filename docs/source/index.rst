Hi. Wellcome to my online note. My name is Aulia Khalqillah. Thank you for visiting my online note. I’m a researcher at the Geological Hazards Division, `Tsunami and Disaster Research Center (TDMRC) <https://tdmrc.usk.ac.id/>`_, Universitas Syiah Kuala (USK), Banda Aceh. My fields are Seismic Hazard-Risk Analysis, Microtremor Data Analysis, and Computational Seismology, all related to earthquake science. I try to study the earthquake from physics and statistics perspectives. Based on that, I hope we can understand behavior of an earthquake more comprehensively.

In this note, you will find the explanation regarding fundamental algorithm, numerical methods, and seismic hazard. I will share all of these topic based on my experience. I hope this will help you to gain more the knowledge in the scientific field, especially in earthquake science.
