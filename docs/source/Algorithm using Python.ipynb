The programming language will be translated to computer language and then the process will be recognized by the computer machine. In this century, algorithms are very useful in solving engineering or scientific problems (scientifically speaking). Every technology that we see today, mobile apps, web apps, artificial intelligence, etc, they are constructed from a collective of algorithms. Here, I share the fundamentals of algorithms, implemented in Python programming language. There are two topics of fundamental algorithm, logical statement (if and else) and looping (iteration)."],"metadata":{"id":"vTex4Ssi6qkJ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## If and Else (Logic)\n","\n","There is a logic process in programming that has two or more conditions, such as `yes` and `no` or also like categorical process such as `low`, `medium`, and `high`.
