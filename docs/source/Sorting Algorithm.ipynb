Have you wondering how does it can be done? Here is the algorithm explanation.\n","\n","Suppose we have a list of data such as data=(3,2,6,0). We want to sort this data from minimum to maximum by using a computer code through an algorithm. Of course, this is very simple data if we sort manually without a computer code. How about we have a lot of data like a thousand or more? Do we want to sort it manually? Of course we donâ€™t. In manual way sort ascendinglly, we know that the data will be data=(0,2,3,6). There are some processes can be done by using computer code or algorithm. I will apply the algorithm by using Python 3.\n","\n","Here are the points of process that you should be noticed:\n","\n","1. Identifying a number of data (n)\n","2. Iterating all of data (i)\n","3. Applying nest-iterating (j) from the first data (0) to the end of data. The end of data is based on the n-i-1. The -1 is used because the index of first data is started from 0.\n","4. If the first data greater than with the next data, data(j)>data(j+1), then the list of data will be updated as data(j)=data(j+1) and data(j+1)=data(j). This is called swap process.\n","5. This process will be continued until all iterations has been completed.\n","\n","Here is the Python code of sort algorithm written as a function of sort"],"metadata":{"id":"xHSu0nFbdOnZ"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# SORTED VALUES, MINIMUM TO MAXIMUM\n","\n","data = [3,2,6,0]\n","\n","def sort(arr, ascending=True):\n","    n = len(arr)\n","    for i in range(n):\n","        # Iterate through the list up to the unsorted part\n","        for j in range(0, n-i-1):\n","          if ascending == True:\n","            # Swap if the current element is greater than the next (ascending)\n","            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n","              arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n","          else:\n","            # Swap if the current element is lower than the next (descending)\n","            if arr[j] < arr[j+1]:\n","              arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n","\n","    return arr\n","\n","# Example usage:\n","sorted_list_ascending = sort(data, ascending=True)\n","print(\"Sorted List (Min to Max):\", sorted_list_ascending)\n","sorted_list_descending = sort(data, ascending=False)\n","print(\"Sorted List (Max to Min):\", sorted_list_descending)"],"metadata":{"id":"ZoSDFKL5fNRs"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The output will be\n","\n","```\n","# Output\n","Sorted List (Min to Max): [0, 2, 3, 6]\n","Sorted List (Max to Min): [6, 3, 2, 0]\n","```"],"metadata":{"id":"uI-xR4r9fR1b"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The function sort is requested variable of **ascending**.
