To do so, you have to create a setup file. The setup file will allow you to install the Python program (library) into the computer system and you can call it from any working directory. So, in this article, I will share how to create a setup file in Python.\n","\n","## Files Structure\n","The first thing is you have to create a file structure to make your Python installer more looks organized. For example, you have a main folder (directory) named **Calculate-Module** or you can name it as the main title of your Python program. Inside this directory, you will have more than one subdirectory or file. In this case, inside the Calculate-Module, We have test and calculate directories, as well as two files which are README.md and setup.py. The test directory consists of a file (run_myadd.py) to be used to run a sample test of your Python program by a new user. Then, inside the calculate directory, you will have a main Python program (myadd.py) and an empty file named __init__.py. Remember, the empty file must be created and put in the same directory as the main Python program. Then, the README.md is the file that consists of some information related to your Python program. The important file is setup.py. This file consists of some configurations related to your Python program. The whole file structure can be seen as follows\n","\n","```\n","Calculate-Module                                    [Main-folder]\n","  test                                              [sub-folder]\n","    run_myadd.py                                    [file]      \n","  calculate                                         [sub-folder]\n","    __init__.py                                     [initial file]\n","    calculate.py                                    [module file]\n","  README.md                                         [file]\n","  setup.py                                          [file]\n","```\n","\n","## Your Python Code\n","The first thing is you have to make sure that your final Python code has been completed. Remember, when you want to make it installer, your Python code has to be written in function mode. For example, I have a simple Python code to calculate the simple summation between two numbers as follows. The function name is **myadd** and the file name is **calculate.py**\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"vwgzTJulVpcg"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"0bQ-lhpwVkBe","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1737857128533,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":423,"user":{"displayName":"Aulia Khalqillah","userId":"02277450670016457088"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["def myadd(var1,va2):\n"," x = var1+var2\n"," return x"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["I believe the complex Python code will have many functions in different directories.
